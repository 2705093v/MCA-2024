# Week 3
This week's version of Autumn Leaves is not the same as last week's Autumn Leaves. Last week, I imported a pdf of Autumn Leaves from Birka, a website with music courses. The pdf can be found at this link:

This week's Autumn Leaves was bought off of MuseScore, as last week's score didn't have the chords on the scale, but rather written above the scale as letters. This version of Autumn Leaves did not need to be edited when moved over to MusicXML, I believe since it started on MuseScore there was no issues transitioning to the MuseScore Studio. That version can be found at this link:

The MusicXML file from this week is included in the Week 3 folder to keep both the versions organised, and the same is true for Week 2.

The differences between MEI and XML have been inserted below for easy access to reference later on:
MEI included body tags, and was more similar to HTML. MEI has significantly less lines in the code, as MEI condenses things a bit. Music XML has everything on its own line for the most part, but MEI has multiple elements on one line. MEI gives each note an ID, whereas MusicXML does not. This allows you to find each individual unique note, even if it, for example, it a quarter note that is the exact same pitch at a point in the song that has been repeated.

Week 3's version of the mei file has been preserved in the week 3 folder, as has the week 5 and 7 versions in their respective folders. The Autumn Leaves MEI file also exists under the data folder, as it has been evolving throughout the course of the labs.

The code for the styling of the Verovio page in github has been changed in order to make the html page work. The code for styling has been borrowed from IvayloGeorgiev24, who was one of the examples listed on the Moodle Page. The code that has been borrowed is shown below:

<br>The rest of the code is from the code we were originally given.
