# Time Frequency vs Wave Form
A time-frequency spectrogram is able to communicate the instruments being played and the intensity of the song more efficently than the wave-form based analysis. In 'It Don't Mean A Thing', a very intense song, Ella Fitzgerald is scatting over multiple instruments. In the waveform, you can see that this gets slightly louder at the end of the song, but you might not understand why until looking at the time-frequency spectrogram. The time-frequency spectrogram, by looking at the brightness and frequencies of the logs, shows if there are a lot of intruments and singers performing loudly or intensely. In comparing 'It Don't Mean A Thing' and 'But Not For Me', the former's spectrogram is filled with orange. The latter's spectrogram, does have some orange, but not to the degree of 'It Don't Mean A Thing', and it is not as consistent. This is because 'But Not For Me' is a much calmer song, that has some portions with only one or two instruments playing, seen by the periods that have less orange in them. In the wave-form, the waves fluctuate throughout the song, but it is not clear why. In the latter half of 'But Not For Me' instruments start to be layered over each other progressively, and we see a progressive expansion of the spectrogram's frequencies. 'The Girl From Ipanema', while not an intense song, is the Frank Sinatra version, meaning it is played by a big band - so, many more instruments than the other two songs - which is why the spectrogram is very orange across a larger range of frequencies.
