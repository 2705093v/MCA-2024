# Metadata Categories that can be added
Artists
<br>Name of Song: Autumn Leaves (also noted as Autumn Leaves in C, as key is very important in jazz)
<br>Album that it's on: this metadata is not included in the code, as jazz standards are sung by many people on many albums, making it hard to narrow down what albums it has been on with what version.
<br>Composer tag=composer: Joseph Kosma, included in the code
<br>Genre/Subgenre: Jazz, not included in the code
<br>Date of Publication: 1946, included in the code

While it may be useful to see a piece of the code to pluck meta data from it, the actual context of the code is still important to see how the rest of the code exists in relation to the MEI head. For example, you can see in the MEI head that Autumn Leaves is the title of the piece, but how does it actually present itself in the code outside of the MEI head? Later on, the title can also be seen in the page head part of the code, which is used to capture 'textual data' which usually appears on the first page of music (MEI Guide, music-encoding.org).
