<br> Here are the extra files outside of weekly labs that can be accessed make sure to open the first two links in a new tab:
<br>[metaRAW](https://2705093v.github.io/MCA-2024/metaRAW.html) - this was made as part of the week 7 lab.
<br>[Verovio](https://2705093v.github.io/MCA-2024/verovio.html) - this was made as part of the week 3 lab.
<br>[Data Folder MEI File](https://2705093v.github.io/MCA-2024/data/autumnleaves.mei) - this was developed throughout the labs, and is not necessarily specific to a week.

<br>Since I used markdown for all of my labs, I did have some trouble at the end making sure that all appeared correctly format-wise. Luckily, I stumbled across a very helpful tool that allows you to write in markdown in an html file!
This is why a line of code starting with script appears at the top of all of my html files if you look at the code.

<br>This line of code was created by Oscar Morrison, more information can be found [here.](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page)
