## Reflection on its accuracy and identifying any information that has been lost:
In the transcription, quite a bit has been lost or changed. When played on MuseScore, the score after polyphonic transcription still sounds similar, like someone has created a sound-alike of Autumn Leaves to avoid copyright! It seems like a lot of the rhythm has been preserved, but the key has changed completely, the tempo has changed, clefs have been changed, and notes that were on the bottom set of bars in the original score have been moved up to the top set of bars, which does mess with the rhythm in some ways. If you just listen to the song, it can seem pretty similar, but the way the songs appear on the sheet music is very different. Since multiple instruments were playing at once (voice line, and then piano line with chords), it is possible that the polyphonic transcription was picking up on resonances. Resonances can enhance each other, but can also be mistaken for notes instead of just resonances. It is possible it also doesn't have the correct instrument information, and was making assumptions from there that confused the way the sheet music turned out after transcription.
