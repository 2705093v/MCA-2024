Here you can find a guide to each week's write up and what documents or files you can find in that week's write up. There is a link to each week's write up, and the documents/files will be linked too.

<br>Since I used markdown for all of my labs, I did have some trouble at the end making sure that all appeared correctly format-wise. Luckily, I stumbled across a very helpful tool that allows you to write in markdown in an html file!
This is why a line of code starting with script appears at the top of all of my html files if you look at the code.

<br>This line of code was created by Oscar Morrison, more information can be found [here.](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page)
