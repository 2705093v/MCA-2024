# Week 2: 
(I was not present for group activity this week, which is why it is not referenced) 
For the song Autumn Leaves, I first tried to convert the sheet music from the real book, but it was unsucessful so I had to find a PDF of the song elsewhere (with lyrics in the same key). In making that first transition from one version of the sheet music to the other, some data has already been lost, including the author and directions on style. When moving to MuseScore, it gets even worse. The key has changed - the one sharp that signifies E Minor has disappeared. The time signature, previously 4/4, has magically become 6/8. The chords for guitar players have been replaced by Ped (instructing a pianist to press the pedal), and the cut time (symbol to change to 2/2) has been added throughout the song. Also the lyrics have disappeared! Most of the notes are wrong as well, and I'm having to go through and edit note by note (both in length and note). I have edited the first ten bars.
